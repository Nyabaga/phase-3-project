## Business Understanding:
###  Overview
The Lending Club Platform is a platform that allows individuals to loan other individuals.Not all loans are created equal. Someone who is a essentially a sure bet to pay back a loan will have an easier time getting a loan with a low interest rate than someone who appears to be riskier. And for people who are very risky may not even get a loan offer, or they may not have accepted the loan offer due to a high interest rate.As a data scientist in this platform I have been tasked with the duty of comming up with a predictive model that solves the issue to avoid loosing funds or loosing customers.

**challenge:** The problem that led to this project is that the traditional creditworthiness assesments.This situation can limit access to credit for some borrowers or lead to inefficiencies for lenders. A more accurate and inclusive method of assessing creditworthiness is needed to improve the lending process for both sides.

**solution:** This project proposes a solution that leverages the power of machine learning to move beyond the limitations of traditional creditworthiness assessments leading to: More accurate predictions of loan repayment behavior,potentially identify creditworthy borrowers who might be overlooked by traditional methods and automate some aspects of the credit assessment process.

>Problem statement: the aim of this project is to build a model that predicts if LendingClub loans will be paid back or defaulted. We'll use LendingClub's data on borrowers, loans, and repayment history to find factors affecting repayment. By applying machine learning, we want to create an accurate model to help financial institutions assess creditworthiness, improve risk management, and make better lending decisions.
